# materials
Dispersion data for many materials, including:
1. Index of refraction, n
2. Group index, ng
3. Group velocity dispersion, GVD
4. Third order dispersion, TOD
5. Higher order dispersion, HOD

Based off sellmeir equations mostly from refractiveindex.info.

Birefringent class for angle dependence.

See materials.ipynb for example usage.
